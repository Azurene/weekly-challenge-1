### Description
The challenge for this week was to edit the starter code in a way that made the HTML follow accessibility standards, as well as edit the CSS to follow a logical structure.
#### What was done
* changed the ``<div>`` tags into semantic elements such as ``<header>``, ``<nav>``, ``<section>``, ``<article>``, and ``<footer>``.
* added comments in the CSS and sorted through the classes and selectors to follow a logical flow, such as ``/* Header Start*/`` and ``/* Header End */`` to make it more navigable.
* changed the ``title`` to reflect the name of the webpage, in this case "Horiseon"
